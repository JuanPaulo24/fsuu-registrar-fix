# ðŸš€ Fix Pusher Configuration

## The Issue
Your `BROADCAST_DRIVER` is currently set to `reverb` but should be `pusher` for the messaging system to work.

## Quick Fix

**Step 1: Update your `.env` file**

Find this line in your `.env` file:
```env
BROADCAST_DRIVER=reverb
```

Change it to:
```env
BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher
```

**Step 2: Clear config cache**
```bash
php artisan config:clear
```

**Step 3: Restart queue worker**
```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

## Your Current Working Credentials
âœ… PUSHER_APP_ID: 2049163
âœ… PUSHER_APP_KEY: 56b7ec672a65a68b605b  
âœ… PUSHER_APP_SECRET: (hidden but working)
âœ… PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER: ap1

## Frontend Environment Variables
Make sure these are in your `.env` file:
```env
VITE_PUSHER_APP_KEY=56b7ec672a65a68b605b
VITE_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=ap1
```

## Test After Fix
After making the change, run:
```bash
php artisan pusher:validate
php artisan messaging:test
```

The validation should show "Broadcasting driver set to Pusher" instead of the warning.
