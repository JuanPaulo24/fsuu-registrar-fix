To all models: Use tailwind, if customization use sass in the /resources/sass and follow codebase structure. if needed don't touch other components and also after user prompting please read the codebase first how it was apply to other components. Dont write a documentation unless if the user prompt, please follow only user prompt dont take any outside of user prompt scope. Don't add a unecessary code like console that can leak data in the system. Don't forget our goal also is to optimize the system.

If model Claude:
I need you to only focus on this specific problem or matter do not ever touch my other lines of codes or block of codes only focus on implementing this in (project)   MAKE SURE NOT T CREATE ANY linter errors! avoid linter errors! instead of removing a block of code you must fix it!! FULLY CREATE THIS ALGORITHM AND DO NOT TOUCH THE OTHER COMPONENTS BECAUSE IT MIGHT DESTROY MY OTHER COMPONENTS! DO NOT REMOVE ANY CODE IF IT IS NOT RELATED TO THIS PARTICULAR MATTER OR PROBLEM! ONLY REMOVE CODE IF IT IS NECESSARY BUT MAKE SURE NOT TO DESTROY THE STRUCTURE! before editing make sure to fully read all the contents of my file (project) to better understand the flow of the code now fully fix this! 

to avoid any of this error you can do it parts by parts to avoid this kinds of error because of too large of the file contents!

When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match on the first try, use the Agent tool to perform the search for you. For example:\n' +
        '\n' +
        '- If you are searching for a keyword like "config" or "logger", the Agent tool is appropriate\n' +
